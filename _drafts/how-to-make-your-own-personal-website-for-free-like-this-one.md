Want to make your own website just like this one? In this post, I take you through the steps I used to create this site. I am grateful to these pages, which helped me a lot during the set up of my page.

#Ok, let's get started.. 

## Install 
- Ruby
- RubyGems
- Git
- A decent text editor (I use Atom)

## Create your own accounts on: 
- GitHub
- Netlify

## Create a fork of the template (beautiful-jekyll)
- Go to https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll and create a fork (like a copy) to your own GitHub account:

- Now, go to your GitHub page for your new repository (fork) and click on "Clone or download" button and copy the URL. 

## Make a local clone of your repository
We want to have a copy all the files for your website kept on your local computer. To do this, open a new Terminal window, move to the folder where you want to keep your website folder: e.g. `cd ~/` if you want to keep them in your home folder (Mac/Linux). 

Now copy your GitHub repository here by using:  
`git clone <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> website`. 

You now have a local copy of your website files stored in the folder named "website". Move to this folder using `cd website`. 

## Let's test it out
Now that you are in the parent folder of your website, let's install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll by running: 
`bundle`

Now we can tell Jekyll to serve the site locally: 

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Now, open your internet browser and go to http://localhost:4000. I recommend bookmarking this address in your bookmark bar for easy access later. Hopefully now you see a version of your very own website!!

## Connecting to Netlify
We will use Netlify to post your website to the internet every time you update your GitHub repository. 
- Login to Netlify
- Click "New site from Git"
- Approve, and then select your "beautiful-jekyll repository from the list"
- On the next page, click "Deploy site". 
- You can change the Netlify URL 

## Adding shortcuts to your .bashrc/.zshrc file
I like to add the following aliases (shortcuts to my .bashrc file). 

git add --all; git commit -m 'Update content'; git push origin master

## Notes 
You can use other templates. E.g. if you're into digital gardens, check out this awesome template from Maxime Vaillancourt.

The beutiful-jekyll template has some nice examples of markdown files to edit and look at. See the README at https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll
