There is one version of my CV/Resume that I think is much more important than my most up-to-date version that I send out when applying for jobs and fellowships...

 ...**my dream resume**. 
 
 Relates to So good they can't ignore you by Cal Newport, since you have to think about the things that will make you stand out from your peers. In terms of supporting you financially, it's about being the best in something, selling yourself and having something that other people will pay money for. 
 
One thing that I struggle with is trying to plan my career and future. 

I've never really liked traditional goal setting. SMART goals ... you can still make goals that are not practical. How do you choose which goals are the most important, or are going to help you in the next stages of your life? 

When it comes to career goals (or personal goals) I find it useful to think about what types of achievements are you going to want to have 

### Making a Dream Resume helps: 
- no one else has to see it. 
- so there is no pressure. 
- you can fill it with outrageous things
- forces you to think what you would be proud of achieving, what things you would want to achieve at the end of that time. 

- I am often surprised looking back in my dream resumes from a few years ago - often my real CV looks quite similar.
  
### Things that I find useful when updating my dream resume. 
- have different versions. One for 2 years from now, one for 5 years, 10 years for now, end of career. 
- Be optimistic, but (mostly realistic)
- Put a few things on their that you might think are a bit out of reach. 
- Start with short term - what papers are you working on that you can put on your dream publication list. What position are you in the author list? What journal have they been published in? What year will they be published? 
- What fellowships will you be applying for in the short term? What will they be funding? What will you need to have done by then to make you competitive for these fellowships. 

- How do you want people to see you? What kinds of things do you want to be known for. What do you want to be recognised for? Service to the community? Contribution to scientific field? 

You can use your current resume as a starting point/template. No need to make it fancy or worry about fonts or formatting - no one will see it. Keep the same kinds of headings. 

Think about what types of jobs that you might be applying for in 5 years time. What kinds of skills or qualifications would make you competitive for such a position? How, between now and then, will you be able to achieve those goals. 

Expand on your jobs. List examples of experiences that you might have in your dream positions that would make you stand out. 

Reflect - 
Are there any gaps in your CV? In terms of time off? What did you do in that time off? 
Are there any gaps in your CV in terms of skills or qualifications? 

Look at some current job advertisements that might suit you in 10 years time. What kinds of skills and qualities are in the selection criteria. How would you demonstrate these skills? 
What kinds of things might be changing in the future? How can you position yourself ahead of the curve so that when those changes come you are ready and sellable.
