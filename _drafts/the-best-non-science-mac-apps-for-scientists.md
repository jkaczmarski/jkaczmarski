_**I've put together this list of my favourite (non-science) applications that I think everyone should have installed on their computers - whether you are working as a scientist or not.**_ 

For each type of application, I have listed a few of my favourite options - I would suggest downloading each of them and trying them out to see which one suits you. Many of the applications are free, or at least come with a free trial period. 

I have focused on Mac apps, but many of these will also be available on other operating systems (or have equivalently awesome options). 

**Coming soon 👀:** If you are interested in my favourite science-related applications, I will be writing about those soon (keep your eyes peeled 👀). I am also working on an article about the steps to take when setting up a new Mac (especially for scientists). 

### 📨 An email application
Considering how much our days revolve around sending and receiving emails, a good email app is essential.  
**What makes a good email app?**
- Syncs events with Calendar
- Send later options
- 
**My favourite options**
In my opinion, the default Mac Mail.app is pretty good and tends to be the one I keep coming back to. But here's a few of my other favourites that I have enjoyed using over the last few years.
