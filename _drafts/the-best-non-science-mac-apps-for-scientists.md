_**I've put together a list of my favourite (non-science) applications that I think everyone should have installed on their computers.**_ 

For each type of application, I have listed a few of my favourite options - I would suggest downloading each of them and trying them out to see which one suits you. It often comes down to personal preference (and whether you are happy paying for them or not). Many of the applications are free, or at least come with a free trial period. 

I have focused on Mac apps, but many of these will also be available on other operating systems (or have equivalently awesome options). 


## üí¨ KEEPING CONNECTED
---
### üì® An email application  
**My current choice:** Microsoft Outlook

As much as I try and minimise the use of email (yes, I have been reading Cal Newport's latest book, "_A world without email_"), a good email app is essential. In my opinion, the default Mac Mail.app is pretty good and tends to be the one I keep coming back to. I am currently using Microsoft Outlook for both my email and calendar, and have been enjoying the 'send later' option and overall feel of the "new Outlook" interface. Until recently, I was using Spark for emails and calendar - I liked its clean interface, send later options, and its Smart Inbox option which neatly sorted my incoming mail into sensible categories (e.g. Newsletters etc)

**Alternate option:** Keep it in your web browser.    
One other option is to avoid email apps altogether and instead just check your email using your internet browser. I know quite a few people that just keep their email open all the time in a tab in their browsers, or have it bookmarked for easy access. People seem to have a lot of love for the features of Gmail's web interface (but I haven't personally used it too much). If you're trying to cut down the time you spend on emails, restricting email to use from within your internet browser can also be beneficial, since it tends to create a bit more "friction" to opening up your email inbox (i.e. if you don't always have it open or bookmarked). This potentially makes it easier to be more conscious about when to read and write emails since you likely won't have notifications disturbing you, nor a email app always tempting you from its spot in the dock. 

### üí¨ Communicating with your team, collaborators & friends
**Current choice:** Pretty much all of them, depending on the situation. 

Being able to keep in contact with collaborators, friends and family is important to me, so I always keep these installed on my mac. 
- Zoom. I use this mainly for work-related audio and video calls/meetings. 
- Slack. I use this mainly for work related chat. 
- Messages.app. I hate using my phone, so try and send most of my messages from my laptop. 
- WhatsApp. Mainly for keeping up to date with family. Again, I prefer to use my computer rather than my phone. 
- Messenger. Used mainly for messages to friends. 
- Skype. I always have a bit of money on my Skype account for making international landline phone calls. I am sure there is probably better options for this, but this is just what I default back to.   
- Clocker. For working out what's the best time to call people across different time zones. 
  
	   
## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª A WEB BROWSER
---

## ‚úçÔ∏è NOTE-TAKING, WRITING & HANDLING TEXT
---
### ‚å®Ô∏è A word processor
**My current choice:** Google Docs + Microsoft Word   
  
You may want to consider or explore other options for more speciliased writing tools, such as Scrivner or Ulysses. 

### ‚úçÔ∏è Note-taking 
**My current choice:** Roam Research

Obsidian
Roam Research
OneNote
Notion
Evernote
Word
Google 

### üìù A decent text editor (or three)
**My current choice:** Sublime Text + Atom + Emacs 

TextEdit.app


### üìÑ A reliable reference manager (or three)
**My current choice:** Paperpile + Zotero + Mendeley

When writing in Word or Google Docs, the Paperpile add-ons make it super easy to add citations to your work. You can search papers within your library, or any papers on the web (i.e. you don't have to download them to your local library to be able to cite them!). I find that the citation information is much more accurate than what gets spat out by Mendeley. I don't use Paperpile for collecting/organising PDFs. 

I still use Mendeley when working on documents with my supervisor or other collaborators that use this app. Similarly, I keep EndNote installed for when I am working with collaborators that insist on using it. 

Lately, I haven't bothered with downloading PDFs or copies of papers to my computer. I just read and annotate them online or print out a hardcopy to scribble on. However, I am trying to move towards a system where I use Zotero for collecting and annotating PDFs of papers (in combination with annotations on online articles), so that my annotations and notes can be automatically synced with my Roam Research database. I will write about this once I set it up.
