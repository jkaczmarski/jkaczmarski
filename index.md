I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at **The Australian National University**. You can see [my CV here](cv), [my publications here](publications) and read more about [my research interests here](research).
  
Since you've stopped by, why not [check out my blog](blog), where you will find a collection of my thoughts and ideas on science, life & everything in between. Or if you are looking for a new T-shirt or a gift for your science-y friends, explore <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/theGoldenSmudge/shop?asc=u" target="_blank">our Redbubble Store</a> where you will find some funky science-inspired designs. You can also check out my other blog, <a href="https://tasmaniantraveller.com/" target="_blank"><i>Tasmanian Traveller</i></a> which has some old articles about my adventures in Tasmania and abroad.
