I like to keep my Dock nice and organised, and have put in place a few criteria that help me decide if I want an App to be kept in the Dock or not. In this post, I share what Apps I keep in my Dock, and the criteria that I use to keep it as tidy as possible. 

## My Dock

- **Microsoft Outlook** - email & calendar
- **Todoist** - task management
- **Google Chrome** - web browser
- **Slack** - work chat
- **iTerm2** - terminal alternative
- **Sublime Text** - text editor
- **Roam Research** - note taking software
- **PyMOL** - molecular visualisation

### My criteria for keeping an App in the Dock 
- **Apps that I keep open ~100% of the time anyway** (e.g. email, Todoist, Slack, Chrome). 
- **Apps that I want to use more often.** Keeping them in the Dock acts a reminder to use them more (e.g. Roam Research). 
- **Apps that I use often (i.e. > once per day), that I like to drag-and-drop files into** to open. (e.g. terminal/iTerm2, text editor, PyMOL). 

### Keeping the Dock flexible
Just because the Dock is there all the time, it doesn't mean that you have to keep it the _same_ all of the time. I often pin/unpin apps to my Dock depending on what I am currently working on. For example, when I am doing a lot of data analysis or working with spreadsheets or csv files I like to pin Excel to the Dock. Similarly, when I am finalising figures for a paper and making lots of plots, I pin my graphing software (Prism) and to the Dock. I go through phases of using the 'Show recent applications in Dock' option - sometimes I really like this feature, but sometimes it annoys me... 

## Dock Preferences   
These all come down to personal preference. I keep my Dock at bottom of screen (classic) & turn off magnification. I tend not to hide my Dock, but will often use the keyboard shortcut `Command(âŒ˜)+Option+D` to quickly hide/show it if I need a little extra screen space. **Here are my current Dock Preferences:ðŸ‘‡**
